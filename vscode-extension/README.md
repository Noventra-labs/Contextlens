# ContextLens VS Code Extension

ContextLens is a powerful AI-driven developer companion that captures your coding intent and context as you work, providing seamless integration with the ContextLens Dashboard for deep project insights, active file context tracking, and automated summarization.

---

##  VS Code UI & Integration

The extension integrates tightly into your VS Code workspace to provide a distraction-free context tracking environment:

- **Dedicated Sidebar Panel (`contextlens-explorer`):** Easily accessible from the Activity Bar, this sidebar consolidates your entire tracking workflow.
- **State Header Tree View (`contextlens.stateTree`):** Provides real-time visibility into your active project, current tracking episode, the current branch, and your overall sync status.
- **AI Chat Webview (`contextlens.chatView`):** An integrated interactive chat interface that leverages your preferred AI models to answer questions, write diffs, and explain file differences in real-time.
- **Interactive Title Menu Actions:** Quick-action buttons in the view headers let you open the web dashboard in one click.

## Extension Features

### Episode-Based Intent Tracking
Organize your coding context cleanly by starting discrete tracking episodes. Grouping changes by feature branch or specific task ensures clean history and accurate summaries.

###  AI-Powered Context Capture
Automatically captures file diffs and active file context during AI assistant interactions, tracking code changes and intent continuously.

###  Seamless Auth Sync
Integrated authentication utilizing secure callbacks (`vscode://Noventra-Labs.contextlens`) connecting Firebase Auth directly from the web dashboard.

###  Deep Dashboard Integration
Instant navigation hooks to open your specific projects, active branches, or episodes directly in the web dashboard for deep timeline inspection.

## ⌨ Keyboard Shortcuts & Keybindings

Quickly manage your tracking states without leaving your code editor using global shortcuts:

| Command | Action | Keyboard Shortcut (Windows/Linux) | Keyboard Shortcut (macOS) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `contextlens.newEpisode` | Start a new tracking episode | `Ctrl + Alt + N` | `Cmd + Alt + N` |
| `contextlens.closeEpisode` | Close active episode | `Ctrl + Alt + X` | `Cmd + Alt + X` |

*(Shortcut customization can be toggled via the `contextlens.enableShortcuts` settings entry.)*

---

##  Configuration Settings

Configure extension behaviors through the standard VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`):

*   **`contextlens.enableShortcuts`** (`boolean`, default: `true`):
    Enable global keyboard shortcuts for starting and ending episodes.
*   **`contextlens.apiUrl`** (`string`, default: `https://us-central1-contextlens-backend-001.cloudfunctions.net/api`):
    The base URL pointing to your ContextLens backend APIs.
*   **`contextlens.firebaseApiKey`** (`string`, default: empty):
    Firebase Web API key used for custom-token exchange and token refresh.
    **Leave blank in published builds.** Set this in your VS Code `settings.json`
    only for local development. Production builds inject the key at build time
    via the `FIREBASE_API_KEY` environment variable (see "Building" below).
*   **`contextlens.tokenRefreshMinutes`** (`number`, default: `45`, range: `5–55`):
    How often the extension proactively refreshes the Firebase ID token.
    Must stay under the 60-minute Firebase ID-token TTL.

---

## Building

Production `.vsix` packages require a Firebase Web API key at build time. Set
the `FIREBASE_API_KEY` environment variable before running `npm run package`:

```bash
# In a `.env.production` file (gitignored), or:
export FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIza…"
npm run package
```

Webpack's `DefinePlugin` inlines the value as `__FIREBASE_API_KEY__` in the
bundled output. If the variable is unset, the build prints a warning and the
bundled extension will throw on sign-in until the key is provided via
`contextlens.firebaseApiKey` in VS Code settings (dev only).
